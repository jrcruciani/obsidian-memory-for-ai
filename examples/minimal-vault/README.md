# Example: Minimal Vault

A complete, working example of the memory system described in the [guide](../../guide.md).

**The persona is fictional.** Elena Voss is an invented art conservator. The vault demonstrates real structure and conventions using a domain (pigment research, museum conservation) that's different enough from software engineering to show the system works for anyone, not just developers.

## How to use it

1. **Read through the files** to see how the conventions from the guide look in practice
2. **Copy the structure** to your own vault and replace the content with yours
3. Start with just `CLAUDE.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `memory/glossary.md` — add the rest as you need it

## Things to notice

- **CLAUDE.md is under 80 lines.** Dense, scannable, no filler. It's a router, not a warehouse. Everything else lives in `memory/`.
- **The glossary resolves ambiguity.** "The manuscript" means the Strasbourg MS. "GG" means the museum. The AI won't have to guess.
- **People profiles include what matters for AI context**, not a full biography. Marta's communication preferences and data format expectations are there because they affect collaboration.
- **The decision record captures *why*, not just *what*.** DEC-001 explains why Markdown+CSV was chosen over SQLite — so a future session won't suggest the same rejected alternatives.
- **`working-context.md` is a mutable snapshot.** It captures what matters *right now* — active threads, pending items, recent decisions — so the AI has temporal context without loading full project files. The AI rewrites it at session end.
- **`recent-sessions.md` is a recency buffer.** One line per session, capped at ~10 entries. It gives the AI a sense of momentum and sequence without full conversation replay.
- **Wikilinks with relationship verbs** (`supports:`, `applies:`, `related:`) connect files into a navigable graph.
- **Frontmatter is minimal but consistent.** Type, relevance, last_reviewed on every memory file — and `last_reviewed` means semantic review, not "a bot touched this file during an audit."
